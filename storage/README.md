# Storage documentation
A short documentation of the files and scripts in storage.

Note: This directory is meant to be used as a storage for different, old or deprecated versions of our current model. Most of these scripts are currently unsupported and do not work out of the box.

## Structure
 - **AirSim**: Contains a first version of the data gathering script used for the AirSim driving simulator developed by Microsoft. After switching to CARLA we did not continue developing code for AirSim.
 - **evaluation**: Contains an old version of the evaluation code.
 - **helper_scripts**: Contains the original preprocessing scripts by Phillip Lippe.
 - **preprocessing**: Contains modified preprocessing scripts and our extension for TFRecords.
 - **MCNet**: Contains the original codebase by Phillip Lippe and some of our early modifications.
